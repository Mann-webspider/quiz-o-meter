      # Saving a code file can cause an incremental build, a hot reload in the browser,
      # and a reconnection of the debugger.

      # Changes on the host, like saving a code file, immediately affect the container.
      # Changes within the container, like build output, make their way back to the host,
      # but are not strictly synchronized.
